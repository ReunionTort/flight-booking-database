# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Booking Database Project(Areyeng Flights)

This project was developed as part of my Higher Certificate in IT. It simulates a flight booking system Database using Microsoft SQL Server.
## üìÑ Project Specifications
- Created normalized tables with appropriate constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL, etc.)
- Populated tables with sample data
- Created SQL views such as:
  - `vw_Flight`(Displays all flights )
  - `vw_AffordableFlight`(Displays top 3 cheapest flights)
  - `vw_SeniorUsers`(Displays all Customers whose age > 55)
- Implemented stored procedures to add/update/delete/ on flight bookings
	-sp_UpdateFlyingTimes
	-sp_DeleteTicket
	-sp_AddNewFlight

## üí° Tech Stack
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL (T-SQL)
